          <p>
            Hydroponic farming is a method of growing plants without soil, using
            water solutions rich in nutrients. Here are some key points:
            Principle: Growing plants in nutrient-enriched water instead of
            soil. System: Using artificial mediums such as rockwool or clay
            pebbles to hold plant roots. Nutrition: Providing precise and
            controlled nutrient delivery directly to the roots. Advantages:
            Water conservation, faster growth, and better control of growing
            conditions. Applications: Particularly suitable for growing leafy
            vegetables, tomatoes, cucumbers, and herbs. Environment: Allows food
            production in urban environments and areas with limited soil.
            Challenges: Requires high initial investment and technical knowledge
            for optimal operation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hydroponic cultivation offers significant advantages in terms of
            sustainability and global food security. This method enables food
            production in densely populated areas, such as large cities, and in
            regions with extreme climate conditions or infertile soil. It
            significantly reduces water usage (up to 90% less compared to
            traditional agriculture) and prevents soil and water pollution from
            fertilizers. Additionally, hydroponic farming allows for year-round
            food production, independent of seasons or weather conditions.
            However, the main challenges include the high cost of setting up
            hydroponic systems, the need for energy for lighting and climate
            control, and the risk of technical failures that could affect the
            entire crop. Nevertheless, with advancing technology and decreasing
            costs, it is expected that hydroponic cultivation will play a more
            significant role in the future of global food production.
